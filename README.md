Android 4.4 (KitKat) introduced translucent system UI styling for status and navigation bars. These styles are great for wallpaper based activities like the home screen launcher, but the minimal background protection provided makes them less useful for other types of activity unless you supply your own backgrounds inside your layout. Determining the size, position and existence of the system UI for a given device configuration can be non-trivial.
